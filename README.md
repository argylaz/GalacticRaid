## **Galactic-Raid** <br/>
### A River-Raid adaptation using Raylib <br/> <br/>

## **General info about the project** <br/>
- In the repository you will find the default River-Raid game as close to the original atari one as i could make it along with 
  a "more fun" adaptation of it galactic raid. <br/>
- You can play either of the games by running "make run" on the correspondant directory.
- These applications are made for linux so if you wants to play on windows you will need to run it using WSL, and to download Xlaunch   (an app that allows linux application's to open windos on a windows system), open it and run "export DISPLAY=:0" before "make run".<br/>
- However sound and music can only be heard on linux, there are some ways to activate it on wsl but a dual boot or a virtual box is a lot easier to set up for some reason. <br/><br/><br/>

## **About Galactic-Raid** <br/>
 **The Galactic-Raid game is basically River-Raid but with some changes that i thought would make the game more attractive**<br/><br/>
 - A menu has been added that includes an about page (brief description of the game), and a settings page that allows the user to change
   the background song, the volume of the music and the spawn rate of the orbs(look below).<br/>
 - A space theme (thus the tittle of the game) with sound effects and textures i found on the internet<br/>
 - A random power-up mechanic. Orbs spawn randomly in the level that the player can pick up. When picked up, the player can activate     (using space) one of the three power-ups below (at random).<br/>
  1. LASER: A huge laser beam is shot from the rocket that destroy's anything it touches and lasts for about 1.5 seconds.<br/>
  2. POWERBLAST: A big blast is shot from the rocket that destroy's anything in it's path until it disappers when it get's off-screen<br/>
  3. SHEILD: The rocket is coated with a shield that allow's it to take a hit without getting destroyed (only one can be active at the same time).<br/><br/><br/><br/>
